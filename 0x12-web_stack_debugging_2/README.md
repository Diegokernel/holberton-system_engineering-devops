# Web Stack Debugging 2

### Description
Learning more debugging concepts

### File Content
This repository contains the following files*:

| File | Task |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0-iamsomeonelese | Write a Bash script that accepts one argument. The script should run the whoami command under the user passed as an argument |
| 1-run_nginx_as_nginx | he root user is a superuser that can do anything on a Unix machine, the top administrator. Security wise, you must do everything that you can to prevent an attacker from logging in as root. With this in mind, itâ€™s a good practice not to run your web servers as root (which is the default for most configurations) and instead run the process as the less privileged nginx user instead. This way, if a hacker does find a security issue that allows them to break-in to your server, the impact is limited by the permissions of the nginx user. Fix this container so that Nginx is running as the nginx user. |
| 100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less | Using what you did for task #1, your Bash script must be 7 lines long or less |
